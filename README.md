# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

## Let's get started:
* Open `index.html` in Chrome, and open the developer tools console.
* Open up your `script.js` file in Sublime.

## The fun stuff:
* Use `prompt()` to ask the user to choose between "rock, paper, or scissors". Save this as a variable called `userChoice`
* Write `console.log("The user chooses: " + userChoice);` below your prompt and refresh the webpage to make sure it's working.
* Write a function called `declareWinner`. It should take in two arguments (the `userChoice` and the `computerChoice`). 
  * If the computer wins it should return "The computer won!"
  * If the user wins it should return "You won!"
* Good luck!
